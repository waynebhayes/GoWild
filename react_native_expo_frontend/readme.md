## Frontend 

This project is built with a react native framework called `expo` https://expo.io/learn for easier preview and test.

Before working on any part of code, I highly recommend going over tutorial of `react native` and `expo`. 

To start it locally, first install node js, then install expo and all dependencies with `npm install`, then init it with `expo start` to open a web client which contains further instruction on how to view it in mobile device. 

UI framework is called `native base`, docs: https://docs.nativebase.io/
